# bsnes-plus-ext-qt

This is a subset of Qt for use with https://github.com/devinacker/bsnes-plus for development and distribution purposes only, to permit building of bsnes-plus without adding Qt to Windows' PATH.

This should be updated from the full Qt distribution, and should only include the same files (or a similar set) as what is initially present.
